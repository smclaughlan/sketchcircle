## SketchCircle at a Glance
Sketchcircle is designed to support the features specific to art improvement sketchbook communities. In addition to posting to and favoriting sketchbooks, users can set goals and view an image only timeline for each sketchbook.

## Front-end
The front-end of SketchCircle uses JavaScript, React, Redux, and MaterialUI.

### React
SketchCircle uses React to create a smooth user experience.

### Redux
Redux is used to store the site's data on the front-end.

### MaterialUI
MaterialUI components were used to save time and create a uniform look and feel.

## Back-end
The back-end uses Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL.

### PostgreSQL
The database stores everything from users, to posts, to favorites, goals and goal data points.

### Flask
Flask is also used on the back-end for saving to and querying the database.

## Conclusion
My two main goals with this project were learning more about redux and also making a project with at least a few real users in mind. I got to spend more time with redux on this project than any in the past. I also discussed the features that potential users would want from something like SketchCircle, which is where the goal setting and image-only timeline came from. It was a fun project, over all.
